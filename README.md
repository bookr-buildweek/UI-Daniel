Bookr is a social media app that allows teachers to view and give realworld peer feedback on textbooks. They can rate each textbook on a 5 star rating with indepth written reviews. This is the basic launch website for the company. Featuring a eye catching launch page which links to the sign up/sign in of the application. The website also has an about page which covers some of the basic marketing and who is the team behind this cutting edge app. 

This website is built to be responsive in a desktop(1000px width), tablet(800px width), and mobile(500px width) environment.

The home/launch page is called hero-page.less as per the naming requirements of the UX designer.

This developing environment makes use of a preprocessor. 

* [ ] Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running `lessc -v` in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, reach out to your project manager for help.
* [ ] Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the `cd` command
* [ ] Once in your project's root folder, run the following command `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`
* [ ] Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the `background-color` on the `html` selector to `red` in your `index.less` file.
* [ ] Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task

Please make sure that you have all the LESS files imported to the index.less.
